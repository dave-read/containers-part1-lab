With minikube the kubectl get pod output does not shot the external IP.  Same problem exists on Azure but there is supposed to be a fix soon.  


In the mean time:

On Azure you can see the new public IP in the portal and k8 tags the ip with the service name, so you can find the ip for a 
service using the tags.

With minikube you can get the url for the service via the --url command

minikube service container-lab-web --url

to scale the deployment: kubectl scale --replicas=3 deployment/container-lab-web

for dashboard: minikube dashboard --url
